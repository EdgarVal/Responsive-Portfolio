        <p>
            My name is Edgar Valenzuela. Im 30 years old, born and rasied in southern California. My parent are both from Mexico but
            moved to the states before I was born. I miss the nice weather but I've gotten used to Arizona, just not the heat.
            </p>
            <p> Im very passionate about my interests and I have a lot of them. Like music, sports, media (video games,
            movies, tv) and activities with friends and family. Learing new skills, like coding, is huge for me to help me
            grow and broaden the scope of my potential and the possibilities I can achive.
